'''
Map the original data file to a evenly spaced grid with user-specified resolution.

The data itself will be stored to a Pandas dataframe (in simple words, a table), with the following titles:
    x, y, z, temperature, velocity_magnitude, z-velocity
Time column is deleted. If the data is sliced, its corresponding x, y, or z coordinate will not be included.
Points out of the original data range will be converted to NaN.

There will also be a dictionary organizing these files, in format {<prefix>_0:Data(path_0), <prefix>_1:Data(path_1), ...}
The prefix is named by user.
